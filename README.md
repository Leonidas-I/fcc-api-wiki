# What i have done  
use jquery ajax with webpack  
use font awesome 5 with dom.watch() and jquery event on it  
use bootstrap css && js in webpack
get rid of unused bootstrap in production css file  
minify html js css in production file  
autoprefixer for generated css  
source map js and css for dev mode  
bundle splitting  

# Things i may improve  
why webpack can't bundle jquery and bootstrap into separated at the same time  
find another way to select i tag to svg tag in jquery  
repeat code in close event  
anyhow to minimize dependency library even more
